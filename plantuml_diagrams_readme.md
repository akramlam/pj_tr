## üìä Report & Documentation Diagram

### **Detailed Report Diagram** (`binome_matcher_detailed_report_diagram.puml`) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Best for technical reports and documentation** - Complete system architecture:
- **All 4 domain entities** with complete attributes (User, Profile, Message, DebugLog)
- **6 REST controllers** with all endpoint methods
- **6 business services** with key operations
- **4 data repositories** with data access methods  
- **3 security components** (JWT authentication flow)
- **Android client architecture** (Activities, Fragments, API client)
- **8 DTOs** for data transfer
- **Complete relationships** showing all dependencies
- **Database schema** representation
- Uses UML stereotypes (<<Entity>>, <<Service>>, <<Repository>>, etc.)

## üéØ Presentation Diagrams (Easy to Explain)

### 1. Simple Flow (`binome_matcher_simple_flow_diagram.puml`) ‚≠ê
**Best for explaining the concept** - Shows user journey:
- How users interact with the system
- Main flow: Register ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí Match ‚Üí Connect
- Minimal classes with clear relationships
- Step-by-step note included

### 2. Presentation View (`binome_matcher_presentation_diagram.puml`) ‚≠ê
**Best for presentations** - Shows core concepts only:
- 3 main entities (User, Profile, Message)

- Clear flow from App ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Database
- Includes helpful note about matching

### 3. Vertical Layout (`binome_matcher_vertical_diagram.puml`) ‚≠ê
**Best for architecture overview** - Shows layers:
- Top-to-bottom flow (App ‚Üí API ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Data ‚Üí DB)
- Each layer's responsibilities
- Clean vertical alignment
- Perfect for slide presentations
